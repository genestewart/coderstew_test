## 2025-07-29: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Create a modern, visually appealing freelance company website for CoderStew LLC that showcases programming and IT services, targeting small to medium businesses, entrepreneurs, and organizations needing technical expertise. The site will feature a professional design with custom brand colors and a streamlined contact form system.

### Context

Need to establish professional online presence for freelance programming and IT services business. Current market lacks personalized, professional websites that effectively communicate technical capabilities while building client trust. Existing freelance platforms don't provide the level of professional presentation needed to attract quality business clients.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Generic Website Template**
   - Pros: Quick setup, low cost, proven layouts
   - Cons: Lacks unique branding, no custom functionality, looks generic

2. **Freelance Platform Profile Only**
   - Pros: Built-in client base, no hosting costs, platform handles payments
   - Cons: No brand control, platform takes commission, limited customization

3. **Custom Laravel Website** (Selected)
   - Pros: Full control over branding and functionality, professional appearance, scalable, showcases technical skills
   - Cons: Requires development time, hosting costs, ongoing maintenance

### Rationale

Selected custom Laravel website because it directly demonstrates technical capabilities to potential clients while providing complete control over brand presentation. The investment in a professional website will differentiate from competitors and justify premium pricing. Laravel framework aligns with technical expertise and provides robust foundation for future enhancements.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Professional brand presence that builds client confidence
- Direct demonstration of technical skills through the website itself
- Complete control over user experience and conversion optimization
- Foundation for future business growth and service expansion
- SEO benefits for local and technical service searches

**Negative:**
- Requires ongoing hosting and maintenance costs
- Time investment for development and content creation
- Need to drive traffic through marketing rather than platform exposure
