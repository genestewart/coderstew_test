### Business Owner Looking for Technical Services

As a business owner, I want to quickly understand what programming and IT services are available, so that I can determine if CoderStew LLC can meet my technical needs.

The user will visit the homepage and scroll to the services section where they'll see clearly categorized service offerings with brief descriptions. Each service category will highlight the value proposition and technical capabilities, helping the business owner understand expertise areas and make an informed decision about reaching out.

### Startup Founder Seeking Development Partner

As a startup founder, I want to see the breadth of technical skills available, so that I can evaluate if this is the right partner for my product development needs.

The services section will display both programming services (web development, mobile apps, custom software) and IT services (consulting, system setup, maintenance), giving founders confidence that their technical needs can be handled comprehensively by one provider.
