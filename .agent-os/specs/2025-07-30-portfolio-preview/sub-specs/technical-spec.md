# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-30-portfolio-preview/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-30
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- PortfolioPreview component built with Vue.js 3 Composition API
- ProjectCard sub-component for individual project displays
- Responsive grid layout using Tailwind CSS classes
- Integration with CoderStew brand colors and design system
- Technology tag system with consistent styling
- Placeholder images or mockup screenshots for projects
- Semantic HTML structure for SEO and accessibility

## Approach Options

**Option A:** Single component with hardcoded project data
- Pros: Simple implementation, fast loading, no external dependencies
- Cons: Hard to maintain, less flexible for future updates

**Option B:** Modular components with structured data (Selected)
- Pros: Reusable ProjectCard component, easy to maintain, scalable for future enhancements
- Cons: Slightly more complex structure

**Rationale:** Selected modular approach because it aligns with existing component architecture, allows for easy updates to project data, and provides flexibility for future portfolio expansion.

## External Dependencies

- **Lucide Vue** - Icons for technology tags and project links
- **Justification:** Already integrated in project, provides consistent iconography

## Component Structure

### PortfolioPreview Component
- Location: `resources/js/components/PortfolioPreview.vue`
- Main container component with section header and project grid
- Manages project data and layout

### ProjectCard Sub-component
- Location: `resources/js/components/portfolio/ProjectCard.vue`
- Props: `project` (object with title, description, image, technologies, type)
- Displays individual project information with consistent styling

## Sample Project Content

### Project Types to Showcase
1. **E-commerce Platform** - Web application demonstrating full-stack capabilities
2. **Business Management System** - Custom software for workflow automation
3. **Mobile-Responsive Website** - Professional website with modern design
4. **API Integration Project** - Backend service with third-party integrations

### Project Data Structure
```javascript
{
  title: "Project Name",
  description: "Brief description of project and value delivered",
  image: "/path/to/screenshot-or-mockup.jpg",

  type: "Web Application", // or "Website", "Mobile App", "API Service"
  highlights: ["Key achievement 1", "Key achievement 2"]
}
```

## Visual Design Elements

## Placeholder Content Strategy

Since real client projects may not be available:
- Use generic project names and descriptions
- Create mockup screenshots or use placeholder images
- Focus on technology stack and problem-solving approach
- Highlight different types of solutions (web, mobile, backend)
- Demonstrate range of technical capabilities
