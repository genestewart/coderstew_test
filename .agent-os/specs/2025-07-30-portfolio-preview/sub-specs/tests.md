# Tests Specification

This is the tests coverage details for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-30-portfolio-preview/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-30
> Version: 1.0.0

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**PortfolioPreview Component**
- Renders section header correctly
- Displays project grid with proper responsive classes
- Handles empty project array gracefully
- Props validation for project data structure

**ProjectCard Component**
- Renders project title and description
- Displays technology tags with proper styling
- Shows project type badge correctly
- Handles missing image prop gracefully
- Applies hover effects and transitions
- Validates project prop structure

### Integration Tests

**Portfolio Section Integration**
- Integrates correctly into HomePage.vue after AboutExpertiseSection
- Maintains consistent spacing with other homepage sections
- Responsive layout works across all breakpoints
- Brand colors are applied consistently

**Component Data Flow**
- PortfolioPreview passes project data to ProjectCard components
- Technology tags render with appropriate colors
- Project type displays with correct styling

### Accessibility Tests

**Semantic HTML**
- Uses proper heading hierarchy (h2 for section, h3 for project titles)
- Images have appropriate alt text
- Links and buttons have accessible labels
- Proper ARIA attributes where needed

**Keyboard Navigation**
- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Tab order is logical and predictable
- Focus indicators are visible

### Visual Regression Tests

**Component Styling**
- Technology tags display with brand colors
- Project cards have consistent spacing and shadows
- Hover effects work as expected
- Responsive grid layout maintains proper proportions

### Mocking Requirements

**Image Assets**
- Mock placeholder images for project screenshots
- Test behavior with missing or broken image sources
- Validate image loading states

**Project Data**
- Mock project data array for consistent testing
- Test with various project data structures
- Validate component behavior with incomplete data

## Test Data

### Sample Project Data for Testing
```javascript
const mockProjects = [
  {
    title: "E-commerce Platform",
    description: "Full-stack web application with payment processing and inventory management",
    image: "/images/projects/ecommerce-mockup.jpg",
    technologies: ["Laravel", "Vue.js", "MySQL", "Stripe API"],
    type: "Web Application",
    highlights: ["99.9% uptime", "50% faster checkout process"]
  },
  {
    title: "Business Management System",
    description: "Custom CRM and workflow automation for mid-size company",
    image: "/images/projects/crm-mockup.jpg",
    technologies: ["PHP", "MySQL", "jQuery", "Bootstrap"],
    type: "Business Software",
    highlights: ["30% efficiency increase", "Automated reporting"]
  }
]
```

### Edge Cases to Test
- Empty project array
- Project missing required fields
- Very long project descriptions
- Large number of technology tags
- Missing or broken image sources
- Network failures during image loading

## Test Implementation Strategy

### Component Tests
- Use Vue Test Utils for component mounting and interaction testing
- Test props validation and default values
- Verify computed properties and reactive data
- Check component lifecycle hooks if used

### Visual Tests
- Verify CSS classes are applied correctly
- Test responsive behavior at different screen sizes
- Validate brand color usage throughout components
- Check spacing and layout consistency

### Integration Tests
- Test homepage integration and section ordering
- Verify component communication and data flow
- Test with actual project data structure
- Validate performance with multiple project cards

## Success Criteria

- All new components have 100% test coverage
- Integration tests pass with existing homepage components
- Accessibility tests meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Visual tests confirm consistent brand styling
- Performance tests show no regression in page load times
