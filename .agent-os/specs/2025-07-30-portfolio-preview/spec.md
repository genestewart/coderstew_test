> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a project portfolio preview section that showcases sample work and case studies to build client confidence and demonstrate technical capabilities. This section will highlight successful projects and provide credibility through real-world examples of development work.

## User Stories

### Business Owner Evaluating Technical Capabilities

As a business owner, I want to see examples of previous projects and case studies, so that I can assess the quality of work and determine if CoderStew LLC can handle projects similar to mine.

The user will see a dedicated portfolio section showcasing 3-4 highlighted projects with descriptions, technologies used, and key outcomes. Each project will demonstrate different aspects of technical expertise and business value delivered.

### Startup Founder Seeking Development Partner

As a startup founder, I want to see real examples of web applications and software solutions that have been built, so that I can gauge the technical skills and understand the development approach.

The portfolio section will display projects with visual previews (screenshots or mockups), technical details, and brief descriptions of challenges solved and results achieved.

## Spec Scope

1. **Portfolio Section Design** - Professional showcase section integrated into the homepage after about/expertise
2. **Project Cards** - Individual project displays with images, descriptions, and technology tags
3. **Sample Project Content** - 3-4 representative projects covering different service types
4. **Technology Highlights** - Visual tags showing technologies and frameworks used
5. **Responsive Layout** - Grid-based design that works across all device sizes

## Out of Scope

- Project filtering or categorization (beyond scope for preview section)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Portfolio Preview Section** - Complete portfolio section integrated into homepage with professional project showcases
2. **Project Showcase Cards** - Responsive cards displaying project information, technologies, and visual elements
3. **Technology Integration** - Consistent with existing brand colors and design system
