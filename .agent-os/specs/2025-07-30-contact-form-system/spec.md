## Overview

Implement a comprehensive contact form system that enables potential clients to submit inquiries with professional form handling, validation, and automated email notifications. This feature will serve as the primary communication channel between CoderStew LLC and prospective clients, replacing placeholder contact sections with fully functional form processing.

## User Stories

### Business Inquiry Submission

As a business owner or startup founder, I want to submit a detailed inquiry about my technical needs, so that I can get professional assistance for my project requirements.

**Workflow:** User visits the contact section, fills out a comprehensive form with project details including their contact information, project type, budget range, timeline, and description. Upon submission, they receive immediate feedback that their inquiry was received and can expect a response within 24-48 hours.

### Project Consultation Request

As an entrepreneur, I want to quickly request a consultation about my technical challenges, so that I can get expert guidance on technology decisions and development approaches.

**Workflow:** User accesses a streamlined contact form, selects consultation as the inquiry type, provides their contact details and brief project overview. The system validates the information, sends confirmation to the user, and notifies CoderStew LLC team for follow-up scheduling.

### Service Information Request

As a decision maker, I want to request detailed information about specific services offered, so that I can evaluate if CoderStew LLC is the right fit for my organization's technical needs.

**Workflow:** User browses services and uses contact form to request more information about specific capabilities, pricing models, or case studies. Form captures their industry, company size, and specific service interest for personalized follow-up.
